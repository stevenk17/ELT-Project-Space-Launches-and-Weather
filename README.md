## Project Proposal 

The proposal of this ETL is to extract data from a space launch data CSV and meteorite landing CSV, both from Kaggle. All this data will be transformed, centered around the launch date of each space craft, launched into a Postgres SQL, hoping to tell a story of space launches in relation to meteorite landings.
